## About Me

Hello! I’m Jullian, a Computer Science student at West Visayas State University. I have a deep passion for creation, whether in software, hardware, robotics, or building websites, and my curiosity fuels this drive to explore, build, and innovate. I’m especially fascinated by machine learning and how it can shape the future of technology. Beyond academics, I love immersing myself in the outdoors, expressing creativity through art, enjoying gaming and music, and following the thrill of motorsports. These interests keep me inspired, balanced, and constantly motivated to turn ideas into reality.
